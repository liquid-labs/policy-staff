TODO

## Manual reviews

1. Create a folder in the [Security and compliance shared drive]({{ .SHARED_DRIVE_SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE }}) titled 'Job descriptions and roles review' prepended with the current year and month. E.g: '2021-06 Job descriptions and roles review'.
2. Create a template document titled like '2021-06 Job descriptions review template' using the current year and month.
3. Add a leading 'Instructions' section stating:
   > Please review all the job descriptions to ensure that they describe each position accurately. Suggest changes for any edits you would like to see and use the 'comment' feature to ask questions or seek clarification.
   > * Each job description should have a 1-2 paragraph summary of the position.
   > * Review the list of itemized duties and ensure that all primary duties are listed.

4. Add a table of contents after the 'Instructions' section.
5. Refer to the [Company Jobs and Roles Reference department heads]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}#department-heads), and using the template created in the prior step, create a document titled like '2021-06 Job descriptions review for xxxx@{{ .COMPANY_EMAIL_DOMAIN }}', with the appropriate date and email.
   * Some individuals may be heads of multiple departments, hence the use of email rather than title.
   * Create an additional document for the CEO as needed.
6. Refer to the [Company Organization Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}) and for each job description under a given department head, copy the descriptions from [Company Jobs and Roles Reference department heads]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}) to the appropriate document created in the step above, making each job description it's own section.
7. Copy the CEO, Beard Member, and Board of Directors job descriptions to the CEO's document.
8. Include in each document a copy of or reference to the [Company Organization Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}) for reference.
9. Update the table of contents and share each document with the individual with 'comment' access. This will allow us to review and track changes.
