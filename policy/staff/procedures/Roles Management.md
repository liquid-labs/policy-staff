#### Manual reviews

1. Create a folder in the [Security and compliance shared drive]({{ .SHARED_DRIVE_SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE }}) titled 'Job descriptions and roles review' prepended with the current year and month. E.g: '2021-06 Job descriptions and roles review'.
2. Create a template document titled like '2021-06 Job descriptions review template' using the current year and month.
3. In the template document, add a leading 'Instructions' section stating:
   > Please review all the job descriptions to ensure that they describe each position accurately. Suggest changes for any edits you would like to see and use the 'comment' feature to ask questions or seek clarification.
   > * Each job description should have a 1-2 paragraph summary of the position.
   > * Review the list of itemized duties and ensure that all primary duties are listed.
   > * You may delegate part of the review and update by sharing this document, however you must review and are responsible for any suggestions made as well as the final job descriptions.

4. Add a table of contents after the 'Instructions' section.
5. Refer to the [Company Jobs and Roles Reference Senior Management Team (SMT) section]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}#senior-management-team), and using the template created in the prior step, create a document titled like '2021-06 Job descriptions review for xxxx@{{ .COMPANY_EMAIL_DOMAIN }}', with the appropriate date and email for each team member.
6. Reffering to the [Company Organization Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}), copy each job description from the [Company Jobs and Roles Reference]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}) into each SMT member's document which oversees the job.
7. Copy the CEO, Beard Member, and Board of Directors job descriptions to the CEO's document.
8. Include in each document a copy of or reference to the [Company Organization Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}) for reference.
9. Update the table of contents and share each document with the individual with 'comment' access. This will allow us to review and track changes.
