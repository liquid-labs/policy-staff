# Roles Management
_(SOC 2 Type I ref 1.2, SOC 2 Type II ref 1.2)_

## Purpose and scope

This document discusses the procedures used to review Company <term>roles</term>. These reviews are performed annually and as needed by the <role>Senior Management Team</role>.

## Procedures

### Defining roles

* Refer to the current [Company Jobs and Roles Reference]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}) and Company [Org Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}), if any.
* A 'role' may be 'titular' or 'designated'.
  * A 'titular' role is what would show up on a business card and in the org chart.
  * A designated role is something that staff members may be assigned for various reasons. It may be associated with a titular role or entirely separate. E.g., there may be many 'Software Engineers' but only some of them are 'Sensitive Data Handlers' if they work on sensitive code.
  * Titular roles have managers and show up on the org chart. Designated roles do not.
* Each role has a 'primary managing role' and alternate managing roles.
* And reversing that, each role has potential report roles.

### Roles and org chart review

1. Create a task ticket.
2. Create a folder in the year folder under the [manifest review evidence folder]({{ .s.audits.MANIFEST_REVIEW_EVIDENCE_FOLDER }}) titled like '2021-06 Roles and org chart review', with the current year and month and link the folder to the ticket.
3. Create a Google Doc version of [Company Jobs and Roles Reference]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}), add the current year and date to the name of that document.
4. Refer to the [Company Jobs and Roles Reference Senior Management Team (SMT) section]({{ .staff.COMPANY_JOBS_AND_ROLES_REFERENCE }}#senior-management-team) and identify the current SMT members.
5. Email each member with a link to the Google Doc version o the Company Jobs and Roles Reference created above and also the current Company [Org Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}) with the following instructions:
   > Please review all the roles descriptions and org chart to ensure that they accurately describe the purpose and structure of the Company roles. Suggest changes for any edits you would like to see using the 'Suggest' function and use the 'comment' feature to ask questions or seek clarification.
   > You may delegate part of the review and update by sharing this document, however you must review and are responsible for any suggestions made as well as the final job descriptions.

6. Document the above steps in the task ticket.
7. Once all updates have been made, email the SMT members asking them to verify the final drafts (with links) and then include that email chain in the ticket once all approvals are made.

### Policies by role review

The policy x role mapping tells us which policies are to be read and understood by staff in a particular role.

1. Create a task ticket.
2. Create a folder in the year folder under the [manifest review evidence folder]({{ .s.audits.MANIFEST_REVIEW_EVIDENCE_FOLDER }}) titled like '2021-06 Roles and org chart review', with the current year and month and link the folder to the ticket.
3. Copy the current policy by roles report to the evidence folder.
   - Prepend the ticket ID to the document and append 'original' to indicate this document is the original data set. 
   - Similar names may be used as convention develop, but the name should be unique among all documents.
4. Perform an initial rote review to verify that the roles listed are both correct and complete. Every role in the Company should be listed with no additional roles listed.
5. Assign at least two reviewers to asesss the correctness and completeness of the policy mappings.
   - Particular questions may be referred to managers, department heads, or other qualified staff.
   - Include relevant email chains, discussion notes, or other communication records in the evidence folder.
6. Update the mappings as necessary and include a copy of the updated mappings in the evidence folder.
   - Prepend the ticket ID to the document and append 'updated' to indicate this document is the updated data set. 
   - Similar names may be used as convention develop, but the name should be unique among all documents.
7. Solicit final approval of final policy mappings in an email to all reviewers and attach a copy of that email to the task ticket.

### Job descriptions review

1. Create a task ticket.
2. Create a folder in the [Security and compliance shared drive]({{ .SHARED_DRIVE_SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE }}) titled like '2021-06 Job descriptions review', with the current year and month and link the folder to the ticket.
3. Make copies of the current job descriptions here as Google Docs.
4. Using the Company [Org Chart]({{ .ORG_CHART }}), determine the department head overseeing each role.
   * The <role>Chairman of the Board</role> will handle the CEO, Board Member, and Board of Directors job descriptions.
5. For each department head, mail a list of links to the job descriptions in their department with the following instructions:
   > Please review all the job descriptions to ensure that they accurately describe each job and enumerate the critical duties. Suggest changes for any edits you would like to see using the 'Suggest' function and use the 'comment' feature to ask questions or seek clarification.
   > * Each job description should have a 1-2 paragraph summary of the position.
   > * Review the list of itemized duties and ensure that all primary duties are listed.
   > * You may delegate part of the review and update by sharing this document, however you must review and are responsible for any suggestions made as well as the final job descriptions.

6. Document the above steps in the task ticket.
7. Once all updates have been made, email the department heads asking them to verify the final drafts (with links) and then include those email chain in the ticket once all approvals are made.
