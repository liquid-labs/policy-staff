## Securely storing assets guidelines

In general the rule of thumb is:
1. Make sure your laptop hard-drive is encrypted.
2. Power off your laptop when not in use.
3. Avoid making digital or physical copies of [sensitive data](/Glossray.md#sensitive-data). In other words, keep sensitive data on your laptop or in an approved cloud storage option.

For the purposes of these guidelines, the phrase "sensitive asset" should be understood as any tangible object which is itself or contains [sensitive data](/Glossray.md#sensitive-data). This includes but is not limited to: laptops, mobile devices, or any electronic storage device which may contain sensitive data as well as physical reports, printouts, etc. containing sensitive data.

- **Powering off your laptop when not in use is the easiest way to securely store a laptop.**
  - When powered off and the laptop hard drive is encrypted, the data on the drive is considered to be securely stored and no further special handling is required for data protection.
  - This assumes that all staff laptop hard-drives are encrypted as required by Company policy.
  - You are responsible for ensuring your hard-drive is encrypted before relying on this method.
- Storage in a T15 or better rated safe or a safe of similar construction, bolted to the foundation is sufficient for the secure storage of sensitive assets.
- Never leave company sensitive assets in an unattended vehicle.
- When staying in a hotel unattended sensitive assets should, whenever possible:
  - be secured in a room safe where one is available and sufficiently large,
  - given to hotel management for storage in a central safe or safety deposit, so long as a receipt and indemnification is provided, and
  - otherwise kept on one's person.
- So long as all points of entry are locked, your home and the company offices are considered sufficiently secure for non-sensitive company assets.
